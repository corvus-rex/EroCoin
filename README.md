 A naive implementation of blockchain cryptocurrency + crypto-wallet

This project is inspired by Hackernoon's Blockchain tutorial https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46 while implementing ECDSA for transaction validation of Naivecoin https://lhartikk.github.io/.

I aim to combine the easy-to-understand approach to cryptocurrency from Hackernoon's tutorial while implementing transaction and wallet features from Naivecoin.

This project is for educational purpose only!
